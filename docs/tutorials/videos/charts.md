# Taipy Charts to Update Line Types

Make a line chart for your Taipy application. We're using a basic time series dataset with two variables. You can either use your dataset or get it from the Taipy website.

Charts are visual ways to show and study patterns, trends, and connections in data. Line charts, in particular, show data points connected by straight lines, 
making it easy to see trends and changes over time. You can change the line styles in charts by adjusting the line properties to create different looks.
