In the fast-paced world of business, retaining customers is a top priority. The Churn 
Classification demo, powered by Taipy, is here to revolutionize 
[customer churn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_attrition) analysis . In this demo,
we'll explore this multi-page application that encompasses data visualization, model management, 
model comparison, and predictive analytics.


# Understanding Churn Classification
Churn classification, also known to as customer churn prediction or customer attrition analysis, 
is the procedure of recognizing customers who are probably going to discontinue using a product 
or service and taking steps to keep them. This involves examining past customer information 
and utilizing machine learning algorithms to forecast which customers may leave.

Churn classification is essential for businesses because retaining existing customers is often 
more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By identifying at-risk customers early and 
implementing retention strategies, businesses can reduce churn rates and increase customer loyalty.

# A Glimpse of the application

The [Churn Classification](https://churn-classification.taipy.cloud/) demo is a multi-page 
application consisting of four key pages:

1. Data Visualization: 
    This page allows users to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Users can select the type 
    of graph (scatter plot or histogram) and choose the data content they want to explore.

2. Model Manager: 
    Clicking on the brain icon in the left panel opens the Model Manager. Here, users can access 
    the performance results of the selected model or algorithm. Users can choose an algorithm 
    and chart type to visualize predictions on a validation dataset.

3. Comparing Models: 
    By clicking on the balance icon in the left panel, users can access a page that displays the 
    performance of two models side by side, facilitating easy comparison.

4. Databases: 
    Clicking on the database icon grants access to various datasets, including the training 
    dataset, test dataset, forecast and scoring results, and the Confusion Matrix of the selected 
    algorithm or model. Users can also download specified data frames as CSV files.
