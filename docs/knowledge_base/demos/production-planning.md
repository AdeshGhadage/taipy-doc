[Production planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_planning) is a critical part of manufacturing, 
making sure that resources are used efficiently to meet demand while keeping costs low. 
Taipy's Production Planning demo provides a comprehensive solution for optimizing production 
and cost management. In this demo, we will explore this application that tackles 
the complexities of production planning.

# Understanding Production Planning

Production planning involves strategically arranging resources, materials, and processes 
to achieve production objectives efficiently. It's a vital function in manufacturing because 
it directly influences product quality, delivery schedules, and overall profitability.

# Significance of Production Planning in Manufacturing

In manufacturing, production planning is crucial for operational success. 
It makes sure that the correct products are made in the right amounts and on schedule, 
all while managing costs effectively. Effective production planning leads to several key benefits:

1. Optimal Resource Utilization: 
    It helps allocate resources efficiently, preventing overproduction and shortages.

2. Cost Reduction: 
    Proper planning minimizes production costs, including inventory holding costs and overtime 
    labor expenses.

3. Meeting Customer Demand: 
    It ensures that products are available when customers need them, enhancing customer 
    satisfaction.

4. Improved Quality: 
    Production planning contributes to consistent product quality by minimizing rush orders and 
    last-minute changes.

Taipy's Production Planning application tackles these manufacturing challenges directly, 
offering a straightforward platform to improve production processes and control costs.

# The Production Planning Application

Let's explore each page's functionality of Taipy's [Production Planning](https://production-planning.taipy.cloud/) demo. 
You can select different visualizations across the left panel given:

**1. Data Visualization**

Upon registration with a new account, the initial page reveals critical data visualization elements. 
A central chart depicts the anticipated demand for both finished products, FPA and FPB, 
over the next 11 months, with the current month marked as month 0.

Expanding the Taipy interface allows you to access detailed information for the current month (time 0). 
This includes the levels of Initial stock, Incoming purchases,  Initial production and Demand of the upcoming months, 
all presented in a table format.

**2. Scenario Manager**

This central hub empowers users to create, configure, and optimize production scenarios. 

**Playing with existing scenarios**

It allows you to select a specific year and month, generating two distinct scenarios for 
that month. For each scenario, you can choose from various data categories to visualize, 
including costs, purchases, productions, stocks, and backorders...

Once you've selected the data of interest, you can also pick the preferred 
visualization type: either a line chart or a pie chart. 
These graphical representations provide clear insights and trends.

Furthermore, we've added two sliders for adjusting backorder costs and stock costs, giving you 
precise control over these parameters to analyze their impact.

**Creating a New Scenario**

To create a new scenario, follow these steps:

1. Select the current month and year.

2. Click on the "Show configuration" button.
3. A new configuration panel will appear on the right side of the screen, offering three selectors:
   capacity constraints, objective weights, and initial parameters.
5. Choose your desired parameters using the selectors.
6. Click the "New Scenario" button at the bottom.
7. Your new scenario is now built and ready for analysis.

   
This section streamlines the process of creating scenarios, making it easy to explore different 
configurations and optimize your production planning.
In summary, the "Scenario Manager" tab provides finer control over your scenarios, letting you 
choose displayed data chart types and adjust costs for in-depth analysis.

**3. Compare Scenarios**

This section allows you to compare two scenarios from the same month using the same metrics mentioned earlier 
(costs, purchases, productions, stocks, and back orders...).
It provides a clear example of how the Scenario Manager can be used effectively and highlights the strength of Taipy.

**4. Compare Cycles**

You may have noticed that on the previous tab, "Compare Scenarios," we compared two scenarios per month. 
On this tab, we extend our comparison across all months, from January 2021 to the current month, using two key
metrics: the cost of stock and the cost of back orders.

This tab provides a visual representation of these two metrics in the form of stacked bar charts. 
It allows you to gain insights into how these costs have evolved over time, providing a broader 
perspective on your production planning performance across multiple months.

**5. Datasources** 

You can access and display various tables (data frames) associated with a selected scenario. 
Furthermore, data tables can be conveniently downloaded in CSV format using the 'Download Table' button.
Explore this powerful Production Planning demo, utilizing Taipy's capabilities to streamline 
production planning, optimize costs, and achieve efficient resource allocation.
