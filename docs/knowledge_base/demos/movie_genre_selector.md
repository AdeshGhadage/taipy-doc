# Understanding the Application
This demo illustrates Taipy's capability to analyze CSV files 
and present compelling insights. This demonstration involves the 
execution of a backend process, referred to as a scenario in Taipy. 

The scenario aims to filter movie data based on the selected 
genre. Whenever you modify the genre selection, the scenario will 
automatically run and display a chart presenting the seven most 
popular movies within that genre.
