The dashboard includes two interactive charts: one for "_sales by hour_" and another for "_sales 
by product_". These charts provide visual representations of your data, making it easy for users 
to spot trends, patterns, and connections. Whether you're examining sales trends over time or 
evaluating product performance, these charts deliver valuable insights.

Users can apply filters to Excel data for insightful analysis. Whether they aim to assess sales 
metrics for specific cities or delve into gender-based sales metrics, this tool enhances their 
data comprehension.
