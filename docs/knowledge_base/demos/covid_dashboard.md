Access to real-time data and insights has become vital in a world profoundly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Introducing our COVID-19 Dashboard, a multi-page application that illustrates the synergy between Taipy. 
In this demonstration, we'll guide you through this robust dashboard, highlighting its capacity 
to visualize COVID-19 data and even forecast future trends.


# Exploring the COVID-19 Dashboard
Our [COVID-19 Dashboard](https://covid-dashboard.taipy.cloud/Country) is created to give 
a simple but complete look at COVID-19 information for the year 2020. 
Here are some of the important things it can do:

## 1. **Country Page**

The Country page provides detailed statistics about COVID-19 in a particular country. Users can easily pick 
a different country and switch between showing data cumulatively or in density form. 
There's also an interactive line chart on this page that helps users see the data in a dynamic way.

## 2. **Pie Chart Representation**

A pie chart showcases the distribution of COVID-19 cases among Confirmed, Recovered, and Deaths, 
offering a clear and intuitive way to understand the data.

## 3. **Interactive Map**

The Map page presents an interesting way to examine COVID-19 data. The colors and sizes on the map change 
dynamically depending on the number of deaths in each place, showing a visual representation 
of how the pandemic has affected different areas.

## 4. **Predictions**

The Predictions page allows users to make predictions about future COVID-19 data. Users can do this by naming 
their scenario and choosing a date for their prediction. This prediction is then made for a specific country. 
The dashboard keeps a record of all these scenarios, making it simple for users to look at 
and compare their predictions.

## 5. **World Page**

The World page displays global COVID-19 statistics using line charts and pie charts. 
Users can switch between seeing the exact numbers or how COVID-19 has affected different countries 
relative to each other, giving a complete picture of the pandemic's worldwide extent.
