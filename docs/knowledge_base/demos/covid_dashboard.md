Access to real-time data and insights has become crucial in a world profoundly affected by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Enter our COVID-19 Dashboard, a multi-page application that demonstrates the 
synergy between Taipy. In this demo, we will take you on a tour of this powerful dashboard, 
showcasing its ability to visualize COVID-19 data and even predict future trends.


# Exploring the COVID-19 Dashboard
Our COVID-19 Dashboard is created to give a simple but complete look at COVID-19 information for the year 2020. 
Here are some of the important things it can do:

## 1. **Country Page**

The Country page offers detailed statistics on a specific country's COVID-19 data. Users can 
easily change the selected country and toggle between displaying data cumulatively or in density 
form. The interactive line chart on this page allows users to visualize the data dynamically.

## 2. **Pie Chart Representation**

A pie chart showcases the distribution of COVID-19 cases among Confirmed, Recovered, and Deaths, 
offering a clear and intuitive way to understand the data.

## 3. **Interactive Map**

The Map page presents an interesting way to examine COVID-19 data. The colors and sizes on the map change 
dynamically depending on the number of deaths in each place, showing a visual representation 
of how the pandemic has affected different areas.

## 4. **Predictions**

The Predictions page empowers users to create scenarios for predicting future COVID-19 data. By 
specifying a scenario name and prediction date, users can generate predictions for a particular 
country. The dashboard keeps a record of all scenarios, making it easy to review and compare 
predictions.

## 5. **World Page**

The World page presents global COVID-19 statistics through line charts and pie charts. Users can 
switch between viewing absolute numbers or the relative impact of COVID-19 on different 
countries, offering a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's worldwide reach.
