our platform. In this demo, we will delve into the description and functionality of 
our Face Recognition demo, demonstrating how you can utilize Taipy's potential for real-time 
face detection and recognition.


# Understanding Face Recognition
Face recognition is an advanced technology that enables computers to recognize and verify human 
faces in images and videos. Taipy's Face Recognition demo highlights the smooth incorporation of 
this technology into our platform, offering a user-friendly way to capture video from your 
webcam and conduct real-time face detection.

# The Face Recognition Demo
## Real-time Face Detection
Our Face Recognition demo provides real-time face detection capabilities thanks to the robust 
OpenCV library. Through Taipy's user-friendly GUI component, users can activate their webcam to 
capture video. The system subsequently processes this video stream, promptly identifying and 
outlining faces as they appear. This feature is highly valuable for numerous applications, such 
as security, human-computer interaction, and beyond.
