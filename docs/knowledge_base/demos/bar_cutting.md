Precision bar cutting is an essential task in various industries, and the Bar Cutting demo 
powered by Taipy is here to transform it. In this demo, we will explore this application's 
capabilities, which optimize bar cutting using different algorithms for enhanced efficiency and 
minimized losses.

# Understanding Bar Cutting Optimization

[Bar Cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem) optimization is the process 
of efficiently cutting bars or materials to specific lengths, minimizing waste, and maximizing 
the utilization of raw materials. It's a critical task in industries where precision and 
efficiency are paramount.


# The 5-page application

## Page 1: A Glimpse of the Initial Page

On the initial page of the application, users are presented with the option to select one of the 
two cases they wish to execute. Clicking the RUN button triggers the following sequence of actions:

1. Loading of the selected dataset (Case 1/Case 2 or Case 3).
2. Execution of two algorithms: Baseline and Optim.
3. Display of results, with the loss depicted in blue on the bar chart.

The bar chart represents the cutting patterns, showcasing the lengths of customer bars 
and, notably, the loss. By switching between algorithms, users can instantly observe the 
difference in loss, with the Optim algorithm typically outperforming the Baseline.

## Page 2: Exploring Input Data and Metrics

For deeper insights, users can open the Parameters panel to examine the input 
data for the chosen case. This includes information about available stock (mother bars for 
cutting) and demand.

The Metrics page displays key metrics for both the Baseline and Optim models, offering different 
representations such as bar charts and pie charts. Metrics showcase the loss as a percentage of 
the overall length used (mother bars) or as the actual loss value (in millimeters).


## Page 3: Comparing Model Performance

The balance icon on the left panel leads users to another page where the performance of the two 
models is displayed side by side. This comparative view provides valuable insights into which 
algorithm yields superior results for the selected case.


## Page 4: Comparing Scenarios 

For a comprehensive analysis, users can compare the performance of each model across different 
use cases (scenarios) by clicking on the balance icon. This feature aids in understanding how 
each algorithm performs under varying conditions.

## Page 5: Databases 
The results are summarized and displayed in a table that can be conveniently downloaded 
as a CSV file for further analysis.
