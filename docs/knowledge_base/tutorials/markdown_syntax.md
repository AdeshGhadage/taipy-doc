With Taipy GUI, you can easily create a basic application page using Markdown syntax. This 
covers things like connecting variables and adding visual elements like sliders and charts.

Markdown syntax is a simple way to format plain text and structure documents. It lets you easily 
add things like headings, lists, links, images, and emphasis to text without needing complex 
HTML or formatting tools.
