# Changing Line Types Using Charts

Make a line chart for your Taipy application. We're using a basic time series dataset with two variables. You can either use your dataset or get it from the Taipy website.

Charts visualize patterns, trends, and data relationships. Line charts connect data points with straight lines for tracking changes over time. Customize line styles in charts by tweaking line properties for various appearances.
