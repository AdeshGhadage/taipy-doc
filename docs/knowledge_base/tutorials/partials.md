# Partials in Taipy

Utilize Taipy's *Partials* feature to save time when creating GUI pages and components. *Partials* 
come in handy when you need to use the same page (or part of a page) multiple times in your 
application, like for general instructions, contributions, or generic constants.

Additionally, two other essential visual elements help you structure your application interface:

- **Dialog:** A dialog is a pop-up window with specific behavior designed to enhance the user's 
  experience.

- **Pane:** A pane is another type of pop-up window with distinct behavior aimed at improving 
  the user's interaction with the application.
