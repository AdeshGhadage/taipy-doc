# Partials in Taipy

Utilize Taipy's "Partials" feature to save time when creating GUI pages and components. Partials come in handy when you need to use the same page (or part of a page) 
multiple times in your application, like for general instructions, contributions, or generic constants.

Additionally, two other essential visual elements help you structure your application interface:

- **Dialog:** A dialog is a pop-up window with specific behavior designed to enhance the user's experience.

- **Pane:** A pane is another type of pop-up window with distinct behavior aimed at improving the user's interaction with the application.
