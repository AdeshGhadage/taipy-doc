!!! important "Supported Python versions"

    Taipy requires **Python 3.8** or newer.

Welcome to the **Scenario management** tutorial guide.

The Taipy Scenario management is a set of functionalities used to easily and efficiently 
create dataflows (pipelines), manage and record their executions, and access their data.
It is designed to be used by end-users in a multi-user context and gets especially useful 
for Machine Learning or Mathematical optimization.

# Before we begin

Only Taipy has to be installed. **Taipy** package requires Python 3.8 or newer;

``` console
$ pip install taipy
```

!!! info 

    `pip install taipy` is the preferred method to install the latest stable version of Taipy.
    
    If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this 
    [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
    can guide you through the process.


# Taipy Studio

You have two options for configuring Taipy: either through Python code or by using Taipy Studio. 
Taipy Studio is a Visual Studio Code extension that offers a graphical editor for defining your 
dataflows/pipelines. The configuration can be done easily and quickly with drag and drop.

Now, without any more delay, let's get started with the coding!
