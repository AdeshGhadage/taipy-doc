# Data Dashboards

Take advantage of Taipy's extra visual tools to build a data dashboard. You can upload a dataset 
to the app, tweak settings, and display the data using various graphical choices.

Data dashboards serve to simplify and make complex data visually attractive. They bring together 
data from different sources like databases, APIs, or real-time feeds into one easy-to-read 
interface. Typically, they use charts, graphs, tables, gauges, and other visuals to present data 
in a clear and interactive way.
