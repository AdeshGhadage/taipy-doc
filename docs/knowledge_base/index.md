| 13  | Scenarios |  A Taipy scenario represents a run that can be an instance of a business problem to solve on data and parameter sets.   |  **TODO**  |     [The Scenarios](https://www.taipy.io/tips/the-scenarios/) |
| 14  | Sharing a Taipy Application on Colab with Ngrok |  Google Colab offers a high-performance Notebook environment with CPU and GPU access for deep learning, while Ngrok helps you share your application by creating a tunnel to the internet through a public URL.   |  **TODO**  |     [Sharing a Taipy Application on Colab with Ngrok](https://www.taipy.io/tips/sharing-a-taipy-application-on-colab-with-ngrok/) |
| 15  | Taipy GUI in Jupyter Notebooks |  When using Taipy GUI in Python scripts (.py), we often need to rerun the script after making code changes, while in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), restarting the kernel and running all cells can be cumbersome for coding.   |  **TODO**  |     [Taipy GUI in Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.taipy.io/tips/taipy-gui/taipy-gui-in-jupyter-notebooks/) |
| 16  | Long running Callbacks |  Taipy's "long-running callbacks" feature allows the server to handle resource-intensive tasks in the background, ensuring a responsive user interface.   |  **TODO**  |     [Long running Callbacks](https://www.taipy.io/tips/long-running-callbacks/) |
| 17  | Multi-page application |  Multipage applications help you organize data and visualizations into separate pages for easier navigation and focused insights, and Taipy offers a user-friendly multipage feature to create intuitive dashboards.   |  **TODO**  |     [Multi-page application](https://www.taipy.io/tips/multipage-application/) |
| 18  | Learn about Using tables |  In Taipy, tables serve as both data presentation and control elements, making them valuable for creating data applications with Taipy's unique features.   |  **TODO**  |     [Learn about Using tables](https://www.taipy.io/tips/using-tables/) |
| 19  | The data nodes |  Data nodes in Taipy represent various data types, such as variables, parameters, and models; they retrieve data from different sources, functioning like reliable read and write functions with robust capabilities.   |  **TODO**  |     [The data nodes](https://www.taipy.io/tips/the-data-nodes/) |
| 20  | The CSS Style Kit |  The CSS Style Kit provides a wide range of variables and predefined CSS classes to customize the style of your Taipy GUI application pages, including text styling, margins, padding, display properties, and element opacity.   |  **TODO**  |     [The CSS Style Kit](https://www.taipy.io/tips/the-css-style-kit/) |
| 21  | The skippable tasks |  Taipy includes "skippable" tasks, which can be omitted based on specific conditions.   |  **TODO**  |     [The skippable tasks](https://www.taipy.io/tips/the-skippable-tasks/) |
| 22  | The "on_change" callback |  In Taipy, an on_change callback is a Python function that runs when an application variable changes, allowing you to implement behavior in response to user actions like adjusting a slider or entering text in an input box.   |  **TODO**  |     [The "on_change" callback](https://www.taipy.io/tips/the-on_change-callback/) |
